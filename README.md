# About

This project is focused on experimenting with image processing and computer vision tasks.
It consist of few parts:

* plotting histograms and histogram normalization

* Implementation of simple point operators

* Implementation of noise generation and noise reduction function

* Implementation of image segmentation function based on aerial phots - focused on detecting clouds on pictures

* Morphological operators

## histograms

Creating one-channel histograms for images and observing how point operators affect them.

## histogram normalization

Simple implementation of histogram normalization

## image segmentation using k-means model

This part is focused on segmentation of aerial pictures into two classes - **clouds** and **not clouds**.

Two exampels:
